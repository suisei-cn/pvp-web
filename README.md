# pvp-web

[Experimental] pvp without extensions.

Note that it's only a minimal example illustrating the feasibility of online video cliping without clients or [userscripts](https://github.com/suisei-cn/pvp). Don't expect it to be working for everyone, let alone working well for anyone.

Reach for [Rushia-cn](https://github.com/Rushia-cn/Clipper-Web) (Demo: <https://clipper.rushia.moe/.) for a more complete solution.
